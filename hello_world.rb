 @I'm telling the method to expect an argumen. An arguement is just variable.
 #so when when the method is run it will replace the variable with the actual arguement it was block_given?
 def hello(name)\\puts Hello(name_
 #interpolation means we put the variable in out string but still tell ruby its namr
 
 
 def multiply (arg,arg2)
 puts (arg1*arg2)
 end
 def divide (ard1, arg2)
 puts 
 puts arg1/arge)
